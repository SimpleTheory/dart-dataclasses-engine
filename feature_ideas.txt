Feature Ideas:
• Write complete documentation
    - For this (the engine)(module {readme, library level etc} and function specific)
    - For wrapper (dart side)(module and function specific)
    - Refactor stupid shit
    - Make video

Later:

• Dart 3 is gonna have multi-type returns like this:
      (int x, int y) get_coords() => 0,0
      so learn the rules of when that's applicable and do so accordingly when update comes

------- Maybe --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    • Add parsing to extensions
    • add type def parsing with their content in json serialization
    • parse mixins
    • toMap & fromMap overrides (postponed because of difficulty of implementing at the moment and unnecessary at the moment)


-------- DONE ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPS ARE NOT ITERABLES!!! :(
